For the Variables and Control Structures Capstone Project, assume that you have been approached by a small financial company and asked to create a program that allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator. 
The user should be allowed to choose which calculation they want to do. How the user capitalises their selection should not affect how the program proceeds it. If the user doesn't type in a valid input, show an appropriate message. 
If the user selects 'investment' : Ask the user to input the amount they are depositing, the interest rate and the number of years they're investing for. Then ask the user to select between a 'simple' or 'compound' interest. Output the appropriate amount that they will get back after the given period, at the specified interest rate.
If the user selects 'bond' ask the user the input the follwing : the present value of the house, the interest rate and the number of months they plan to repay the bond. Calculate how much money the user will have to repay each month and output the answer.
